BitsmackGTAPI
=============

Bitsmack Goal Tracker API

The purpose of this project is to pull data from multiple APIs and then allow the user to pull reports on that data.

The first phase is to pull Fitbit step data into a table, calculate the average and trend steps per day, then update the step goal on the Fitbit to try to improve the average.
